# Strategy for managing and presenting an agricultural data management system

Let's break this down into several key aspects:

Considering there is roughly :
- 3 domains
- 15 orchards
- 100 parcels
- 300 harvestings sectors
- 1 000 rows
- 50 000 locations
- 80 000 plantings

1. Data Model Organization
- Hierarchical Structure:
```
Domain
  └── Orchard
       └── Parcel
            └── Harvesting Sector
                 └── Row
                      └── Location
                           └── Planting
```

2. Data Access Strategy
For larger models (locations and plantings):

- Implement pagination with infinite scroll for iPhone
- Use eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Implement search and filtering at each level
- Use caching for frequently accessed data

3. UI/UX Strategy (iPhone-specific with Flowbite)
Top Level (Domains/Orchards):

- Use Flowbite's card components for displaying domains and orchards
- Include quick statistics and status indicators
- Implement pull-to-refresh

Mid Level (Parcels/Harvesting Sectors):

- Use collapsible sections with Flowbite's accordion components
- Implement map view integration
- Add filtering options using Flowbite's dropdown components

Bottom Level (Rows/Locations/Plantings):

- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use Flowbite's table components with fixed headers
- Add search functionality with Flowbite's search input
- Include quick filters and sorting options

4. Performance Optimizations
- Use counter caches for quick counts
- Implement Russian Doll caching
- Use background jobs for heavy calculations
- Implement partial updates using Turbo Frames

5. Data Insights
- Dashboard with key metrics per domain/orchard
- Visual representations using charts for:
  - Planting density per location
  - Harvesting sector productivity
  - Row utilization
  - Historical data trends

6. Code Structure
```ruby
# app/models/domain.rb
class Domain < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :orchards
  
  # Using Rails 8 params syntax
  def self.permitted_params
    params.expect(domain: [:name, :location, :status])
  end
end

# app/controllers/domains_controller.rb
class DomainsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @domains = Domain.includes(:orchards)
                    .page(params[:page])
                    .per(10)
  end
end

# app/controllers/locations_controller.rb
class LocationsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @locations = Location.includes(:plantings)
                        .where(row_id: params[:row_id])
                        .page(params[:page])
                        .per(50)
  end
  
  def search
    @locations = Location.search(params[:query])
                        .page(params[:page])
                        .per(50)
  end
end
```

7. Mobile-First Views
```ruby
<%# app/views/domains/index.html.erb %>
<div class="flow-root">
  <div class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
    <%= turbo_frame_tag "domains" do %>
      <% @domains.each do |domain| %>
        <%= render partial: "domain", locals: { domain: domain } %>
      <% end %>
      
      <%# Infinite scroll marker %>
      <% if @domains.has_next? %>
        <%= turbo_frame_tag "domains_page_#{@domains.next_page}",
            src: domains_path(page: @domains.next_page),
            loading: :lazy %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </div>
</div>
```

8. Recommendations for Large Data Sets
For Locations (50,000 records):

- Implement geospatial indexing if location coordinates are used
- Use batch processing for bulk operations
- Implement scoped searches with compound indexes
- Cache frequently accessed location data

For Plantings (80,000 records):

- Use partial indexes for common queries
- Implement archiving strategy for historical data
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Implement batch updates for mass changes

9. Tuber Scout Mobile App Design
