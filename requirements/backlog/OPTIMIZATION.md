# Optimized Topology Page Loading

## High Benefit / Low Complexity (Implemented ✓)
1. ✓ Implement Rails 8 Solid Cache for View Fragments
   * Implemented view fragment caching for parcel cards
   * Added cache versioning based on parcel updates
   * Used cached_if to conditionally cache based on data freshness

2. ✓ Utilize Counter Caches More Extensively
   * Leveraged existing counter cache columns in the Parcel model
   * Created optimized scopes that use counter caches (locations_count, plantings_count, findings_count)
   * Implemented proper cache invalidation when counters change

3. ✓ Extract Heavy Calculations into Queue Background Jobs
   * Created UpdateParcelStatisticsJob for background processing of heavy calculations
   * Implemented SolidQueue scheduler for regular statistics updates
   * Added tiered caching strategy (immediate simple stats, background full stats)
   * Set different refresh frequencies based on season (more frequent during peak season)

4. ✓ Optimize Database Queries with Targeted Scopes
   * Created specialized scopes for different data access patterns
   * Optimized scope for species filtering
   * Implemented basic and full topology data scopes for different needs
   * Added scopes for findings date ranges

5. ✓ Implement HTTP Caching with ETags
   * Implemented ETag-based caching in the ParcelsController
   * Set appropriate cache-control headers
   * Used timestamp-based cache keys for automatic invalidation

## Medium Benefit / Medium Complexity
6. Add Materialized View for Fast Statistics Access
   * Create PostgreSQL materialized views for complex statistics calculations
   * Schedule refreshes through Queue based on data update frequency
   * Write a service to determine which materialized views need refreshing

7. Implement Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams
   * Use Turbo Frames to load different sections of the page independently
   * Implement Turbo Streams via Cable for live updates to critical metrics
   * Add loading indicators for sections waiting for data

8. Pre-aggregate Common Statistics in Database
   * Extend the current weekly_findings_data pattern to other statistics
   * Store JSON/JSONB aggregates for complex calculations
   * Schedule updates via Queue with appropriate frequencies

9. Implement Pagination and Infinite Scrolling
   * Add pagination for large data sets using Pagy (Rails 8 recommended)
   * Implement lazy loading of content as user scrolls
   * Prioritize loading visible content first

## Lower Benefit / Higher Complexity
10. Create a Comprehensive Data Versioning System
    * Track changes to source data with version numbers
    * Only recalculate statistics when source data version changes
    * Implement a dependency graph to determine which calculations need updating when source data changes

11. Develop a Full Denormalization Strategy
    * Create dedicated statistics tables for pre-calculated values
    * Implement database triggers to keep denormalized data in sync
    * Design a robust update strategy for all denormalized tables

12. Implement Data Staleness Management System
    * Add user-facing controls to view data freshness
    * Create a dashboard for monitoring calculation status
    * Allow admin-triggered recalculations for critical data

13. Build a Complete Asynchronous UI
    * Rewrite frontend to load minimal data initially
    * Implement a state management system for progressive data loading
    * Create a queue system for user-requested calculations

By implementing these optimizations, starting with the highest benefit/lowest complexity items, you'll achieve significant performance improvements while aligning with Rails 8's latest technologies and patterns.
