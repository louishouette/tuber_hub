# TuberHub Authorization System Legacy Code Cleanup Changelog

## Background

Following the recent authorization system refactoring that introduced the new `AuthorizationService` architecture, there remained legacy code that needed to be updated or removed to complete the transition. This document tracks the cleanup of those legacy components and the completion of the migration to the new structure.

## Goals

1. Update all references to legacy authorization components
2. Ensure all code uses the new `AuthorizationService` and related components
3. Improve documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. Complete the migration without disrupting existing functionality

## Refactoring Program

### Phase 1: Controller Updates

1. **Update References in Controllers**
   - Update the `Hub::Admin::PermissionsController` to use `AuthorizationService` instead of direct `PermissionService` calls
   - Update other controllers where direct `PermissionService` calls exist

### Phase 2: Pundit Policy Updates

1. **Migrate to New Policy Concern**
   - Replace `PermissionIntegration` with `PermissionPolicyConcern` in all policies
   - Update `ApplicationPolicy` as the parent class for all policies
   - Remove the `PermissionIntegration` module completely

### Phase 3: Legacy Code Removal

1. **Complete Removal of Legacy Code**
   - Remove `PermissionService` class entirely
   - Update all direct references to use `AuthorizationService` 
   - Ensure no references to legacy code remain in the codebase

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

1. **Improve Documentation**
   - Update `AUTHORIZATION.md` with corrections and improvements
   - Add comprehensive documentation for the audit system
   - Ensure all examples use the new service methods
