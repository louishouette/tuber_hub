# TuberHub Authorization System Refactoring Changelog

## Background

The TuberHub authorization system currently implements a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using Pundit. While functional, the system has accumulated technical debt and exhibits several issues that need addressing to improve maintainability, performance, and security. This changelog will track the refactoring effort to streamline and enhance the authorization system.

## Goals

1. Consolidate duplicate permission checking logic
2. Improve caching implementation for better performance and consistency
3. Optimize database queries to prevent N+1 problems
4. Enhance farm-level authorization
5. Simplify the overall class structure for better maintainability
6. Implement more efficient cache invalidation strategies
7. Add automatic permission discovery for new controllers
8. Ensure consistent admin user checks across the application

## Refactoring Program

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

1. **Document Current System**
   - Update the documentation of the current authorization flow in @docs/tuber_hub/AUTHORIZATION.md and @docs/tuber_hub/AUTHENTICATION.md
   - Refresh your Pundit knowledge by reading the Pundit documentation in @docs/pundit-2.4.0.md
   - Identify all places where permission checks occur
   - Map out the relationships between models and their role in the authorization process

### Phase 2: Core Permission Logic Refactoring

2. **Consolidate Permission Checking Logic**
   - Create a single source of truth for permission checks
   - Remove duplicate logic between `User#can?` and `PermissionIntegration#permission_check`
   - Create a unified interface for all authorization checks

3. **Standardize Caching Implementation**
   - Create a centralized caching approach for permissions
   - Define consistent cache key formats
   - Implement more efficient cache invalidation strategies

4. **Optimize Query Performance**
   - Refactor permission queries to use preloading where appropriate
   - Add indices for commonly queried permission combinations
   - Implement eager loading strategies for user permissions

### Phase 3: Structural Improvements

5. **Simplify Class Structure**
   - Reorganize authorization concerns and modules
   - Improve modularity and reduce coupling between components
   - Clarify responsibilities for each class in the authorization system

6. **Streamline Legacy Permission Handling**

     - Rake tasks:
       - `rails authorization:refresh` - Refresh permissions database
       - `rails authorization:report` - Generate detailed permission reports
   - Updated documentation with examples and best practices

9. **✓ Improve Error Handling and Messaging** (Completed March 26, 2025)
   - Enhanced error messages for authorization failures with detailed context
   - Implemented `Hub::Admin::AuthorizationAudit` model for tracking failures
   - Added detailed logging for permission issues
   - Updated `user_not_authorized` handlers for more user-friendly messages
   - Created authorization system documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Phase 5: Documentation and Cleanup

10. **Update Documentation**
    - Revise the authorization documentation to reflect the new approach
    - Add code examples for common authorization scenarios
    - Create diagrams showing the new authorization flow

11. **Performance Testing**
    - Benchmark the refactored authorization system
    - Identify and address any remaining performance bottlenecks
