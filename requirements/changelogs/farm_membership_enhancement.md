# TuberHub Farm Membership Enhancement Changelog

## Background

The Farm Membership feature allows administrators to add users to a farm. The original implementation used a simple email input field to add users one by one. This enhancement improves the process by replacing the email input with a searchable dropdown that allows administrators to find and select multiple users at once, providing a more efficient way to manage farm membership.
