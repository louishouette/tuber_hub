# TuberHub Development Changelog: Hub Font Update

## [2025-03-20] Hub Font Update

### Changes Made
- Created a dedicated CSS file (hub_fonts.css) for the Hub namespace font styling
- Set Source Sans Pro as the font for all Hub namespace pages
- Applied font styling using CSS specificity with the .hub-layout class
- Configured the stylesheet to be loaded only in the Hub namespace via the application layout

### Issues Encountered
- Initially tried applying Nunito Sans via HTML/body class attributes, but this approach wasn't working consistently
- Changed to a more targeted approach with a dedicated CSS file to avoid conflicting with the Public namespace font

### Next Steps
- Monitor the font rendering across different browsers to ensure consistency
- Consider implementing font preloading for performance optimization if needed
